# Note
This engine is by no means stable or production-ready.
I strongly advise against using this engine at the moment.

## About Artifact
Artifact is a desktop 3D game engine written in Kotlin.

## Getting started
Currently, Artifact is in a too early stage of development to be used as a real game engine.
Sorry :(

## Technology

Artifact uses a node- and component-based architecture, where a node is an object that can be placed in a scene.
A component is an element that can be attached to a node.
Nodes have the ability to have many children, but can only contain a single instance of each component type.
The engine is capable of using [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) (primary) and [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) (secondary).
At the moment there is no working physics engine implemented.

## Q&A

### Do you have a Roadmap?
No, not at the moment. Although, I'm planning to open one.

### Can I contribute?
Yes, you can! Please contribute to improve the engine or fix bugs. Just make a PR and we'll take a look.
