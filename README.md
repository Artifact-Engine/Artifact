## About Artifact
Artifact is a desktop 3D game engine written in Kotlin.

## Getting started
Currently, Artifact is in a too early stage of development to be used as a real game engine.
Sorry :(

## Technology

Artifact uses a node- and component-based architecture, where a node is an object that can be placed in a scene.
A component is an element that can be attached to a node.
Nodes have the ability to have many children, but can only contain a single instance of each component type.

## Q&A

### Do you have a Roadmap?
Yes, we do! Check it out at [Taiga.io](https://tree.taiga.io/project/meo209-artifact-game-engine/kanban).

### Can i contribute?
Yes, you can! Please contribute to improve the engine or fix bugs. Just make a PR and we'll take a look.

### Do you accept donations?
No, not at the moment. But we are planning to open a Ko-Fi.
